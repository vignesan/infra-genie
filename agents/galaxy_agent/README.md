# Galaxy Agent - Automated DevOps Workflow System

An advanced multi-agent system for automated Azure DevOps and GitHub workflow management, built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). Galaxy Agent provides intelligent automation for DevOps workflows with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol integration.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **LoopAgent Architecture**: ADK-compliant loop agent for iterative task processing
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Complete work item management, pipeline automation, and monitoring
- **GitHub Operations**: Repository cloning, branching, PR creation, and code management
- **Webhook Automation**: Automated workflows triggered by Azure DevOps work item comments
- **A2A Protocol**: Seamless agent-to-agent communication with Infrastructure Genie
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent requirement analysis and code generation
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry mechanisms with comprehensive error handling

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure deployment - [Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- **make**: Build automation tool - [Install](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)
- **Azure DevOps Account**: With Personal Access Token (PAT) permissions
- **GitHub Account**: With Personal Access Token for repository operations

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy the `.env` file and update with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Azure DevOps Configuration
AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=your-azure-devops-organization
AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=your-azure-devops-project
AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=your-azure-devops-personal-access-token

# GitHub Configuration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token
GITHUB_OWNER=your-github-username-or-organization
GITHUB_REPO=your-repository-name

# Google AI Configuration (Optional for LLM features)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

### Azure DevOps Webhook Setup

Configure Azure DevOps webhook to trigger automation:
1. Go to Project Settings > Service Hooks
2. Create new webhook subscription
3. Event: Work item commented
4. URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/azure-devops/workitem`
5. Configure authentication as needed


## Quick Start (Local Testing)

Install required packages and launch the local development environment:

```bash
make install && make playground
```

## Commands

| Command              | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make install`       | Install all required dependencies using uv                                                  |
| `make playground`    | Launch local development environment with backend and frontend - leveraging `adk web` command.|
| `make backend`       | Deploy agent to Cloud Run (use `IAP=true` to enable Identity-Aware Proxy) |
| `make local-backend` | Launch local development server |
| `make test`          | Run unit and integration tests                                                              |
| `make lint`          | Run code quality checks (codespell, ruff, mypy)                                             |
| `make setup-dev-env` | Set up development environment resources using Terraform                         |
| `uv run jupyter lab` | Launch Jupyter notebook                                                                     |

## Usage

This template follows a "bring your own agent" approach - you focus on your business logic, and the template handles everything else (UI, infrastructure, deployment, monitoring).

1. **Prototype:** Build your Generative AI Agent using the intro notebooks in `notebooks/` for guidance. Use Vertex AI Evaluation to assess performance.
2. **Integrate:** Import your agent into the app by editing `app/agent.py`.
3. **Test:** Explore your agent functionality using the Streamlit playground with `make playground`. The playground offers features like chat history, user feedback, and various input types, and automatically reloads your agent on code changes.
4. **Deploy:** Set up and initiate the CI/CD pipelines, customizing tests as necessary. Refer to the [deployment section](#deployment) for comprehensive instructions. For streamlined infrastructure deployment, simply run `uvx agent-starter-pack setup-cicd`. Check out the [`agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` CLI command](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/cli/setup_cicd.html). Currently supports GitHub with both Google Cloud Build and GitHub Actions as CI/CD runners.
5. **Monitor:** Track performance and gather insights using Cloud Logging, Tracing, and the Looker Studio dashboard to iterate on your application.

The project includes a `GEMINI.md` file that provides context for AI tools like Gemini CLI when asking questions about your template.


## Deployment

> **Note:** For a streamlined one-command deployment of the entire CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure using Terraform, you can use the [`agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` CLI command](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/cli/setup_cicd.html). Currently supports GitHub with both Google Cloud Build and GitHub Actions as CI/CD runners.

### Dev Environment

You can test deployment towards a Dev Environment using the following command:

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
make backend
```


The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of the Dev Google Cloud project.
See [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for instructions.

### Production Deployment

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of a production Google Cloud project. Refer to [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy the infrastructure and application.


## Monitoring and Observability
> You can use [this Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/46b35167-b38b-4e44-bd37-701ef4307418/page/tEnnC
) template for visualizing events being logged in BigQuery. See the "Setup Instructions" tab to getting started.

The application uses OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability with all events being sent to Google Cloud Trace and Logging for monitoring and to BigQuery for long term storage.
